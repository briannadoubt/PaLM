# PaLM

This is an unofficial REST wrapper for Google's PaLM API.

This Package is _not_ intended to be released into production on a client unless you have the user provide their own API Key. The key is in open memory here and is not handled securely. **DO NOT USE IN CLIENT-SIDE PRODUCTION APPS** until this message is removed.

## Plan

- [ ] Add Vapor server-side support
- [ ] Add secure client support (leveraging the keychain to store user's API key)
